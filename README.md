# 2D Game Optimization

This repository provides tools and utilities to help make your 2D JavaScript games stable and performant. It includes optimizations for the game loop, asset loading, collision detection, object pooling, and general performance improvements.

## Features

- **Optimized Game Loop**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for better performance.
- **Collision Detection**: Basic and optimized AABB collision detection.
- **Efficient Asset Loading**: Preload images for smooth gameplay.
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse game objects like bullets and enemies to reduce memory usage.
- **Performance Utilities**: General optimizations for canvas rendering and FPS management.

## Example

Check out the example `basicGame.html` for a simple 2D game utilizing these optimizations.

## Installation

Clone this repository and use the scripts in your own projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2D-Game-Optimization.git
cd 2D-Game-Optimization# 2D Game Optimization
